# AWS EKS application deployment
This repo is Jenkins pipeline example of deploying application from Github to AWS EKS cluster with AWS ECR image. We will use this [application](https://github.com/Kasper886/guest-book). The application consists of a web front end, Redis master for storage, and replicated set of Redis slaves, all for which we will create Kubernetes replication controllers, pods, and services.

## Pre Requirements
To work with this repo you need started EKS cluster. If you did't it before, go to this [section](https://github.com/Kasper886/WaveProject/tree/master/EKS-Cluster) and follow instructions there.

1. Let's create ECR Repository by Terraform:
```
cd App
```
```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Id you created EKS cluster from previos section you already have Terraform and applied AWS credentials before.
